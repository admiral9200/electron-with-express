# electron-with-express

A simple project which uses Express to serve resources to an Electron app. This is mostly the default Express app that is created by express-generator.

NOTE: This is just a simple app for demonstration purposes. When Electron opens it will request the default route from my Express server
and open a page which uses the YouTube iframe API to play a video on
YouTube.

Requirements: Node &lt;https://nodejs.org&gt;

##How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open terminal to repo
3. Run the following:

```
npm install && npm start
```
