is mostly the default Express app that is created by express-generator mixed
into a fairly vanilla boilerplate Electron main.js file.

NOTE: Electron will be downloaded as a npm module when you run npm install in
the "How to run" steps.

2. Open terminal to repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `bower install`
5. Run `npm start` to start the application
